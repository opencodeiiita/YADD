# YADD

YADD, aka Yet Another DDoS Detector, is an open-source AI-based DDoS detection system designed to safeguard networks from malicious distributed denial-of-service attacks.

## Features

- Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for real-time DDoS detection.
- Provides accurate threat analysis and mitigation strategies.
- Scalable and adaptable to various network infrastructures.
- Continuous monitoring and updates to adapt to evolving attack patterns.

## Timeline

### Week 1: Data Collection and Formatting

- Gather relevant datasets for training and testing the model.
- Preprocess and format the data to make it suitable for training.

### Week 2: Model Development

- Design and implement a robust AI model for DDoS detection.
- Train the model on the collected dataset to learn patterns of normal and malicious network behavior.

### Week 3: Model Tuning, Evaluation, Testing, and Deployment

- Fine-tune the model parameters for optimal performance.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
- Test the model extensively to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.
- Prepare the model for deployment.

### Week 4: Deploying on Real-time Network

- Implement the deployment of the trained model on a real-time network environment.
- Integrate the DDoS detection system into the network infrastructure.
- Conduct thorough testing in a live environment to validate the system's functionality.

## Guidelines 
Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

- People before code: If any of the following rules are violated, the pull-requests must not be rejected. This is to create an easy and joyful onboarding process for new programmers and first-time contributors.

- Single commit per pull request and name the commit as something meaningful, example: Adding <-your-name-> in students/mentors section.

- Reference the issue numbers in the commit message if it resolves an open issue. Follow the [PR Template](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/SaveMyForm-Frontend/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md) Issue: < ISSUE NUMBER >

- Provide the link to live gh-pages from your forked repository or relevant screenshot for easier review.

- Pull Request older than 3 days with no response from the contributor shall be marked closed.

- Do not make PR which is not related to any issues. You can create an issue and solve it once we approve them.

- Avoid duplicate PRs, if need be comment on the older PR with the PR number of the follow-up (new PR) and close the obsolete PR yourself.

- Be polite: Be polite to other community members.
